# CaliforniaHousingData

These data include information such as:
  - population size,
  - median income,
  - median housing prices.
  
Block groups are the smallest territorial units for which samples of census data are published (such a group usually consists of 600 to 3000 people).
The model should learn from this data and, using the remaining metrics, be able to predict the median home prices in any district.
Project activity stages:
  1. Analyze the entire task ahead.
  2. Get the data.
  3. Discover and visualize the data for pattern recognition and additional information.
  4. Prepare the data in terms of machine learning algorithms.
  5. Select and teach the model.
  6. Tune the model.
  7. Present the solution.
  8. Run, monitor, and maintain the system.
